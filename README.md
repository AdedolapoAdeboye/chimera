# Welcome to Chimera 🤖

Hey there! Welcome to Chimera, your friendly neighborhood Telegram bot designed to make your life easier, one PDF at a time! 📚

### What's Chimera all about?
Chimera is not your average bot. It's not here to just chat mindlessly or send you cat memes (although we do love a good cat meme 😺). No, Chimera is here to revolutionize the way you study and interact with information!

### Features 🚀

- **PDF Processing**: Chimera can process PDF files like a pro! Just send it a PDF, and watch as it extracts all the juicy information from those virtual pages.
- **Question Answering**: Got a burning question? Ask Chimera! It's like having your own personal encyclopedia at your fingertips. Just remember to ask nicely; Chimera has feelings too. 😄
- **Group Interaction**: Chimera isn't just for one-on-one chats. It loves hanging out in group chats too! Whether you're studying with friends or just shooting the breeze, Chimera is always ready to lend a digital hand.
- **Automatic Learning**: Every time you send Chimera a PDF, it learns something new. It's like watching a baby robot grow up right before your eyes! 🤖

### How to Use Chimera 🛠️

Using Chimera is as easy as pie (actually, easier than pie because let's face it, pie can be pretty tricky). Here's how to get started:

1. **Add Chimera to your Telegram**: Just create your bot on Telegram from @BotFather and integrate the code or better yet, hit me up to set it up for you (with a little fee though ;)), lemon squeezy
2. **Send a PDF**: Got a PDF you want to learn from? Send it over to Chimera and watch the magic happen.
3. **Ask Questions**: Once Chimera has processed the PDF, feel free to ask it anything! No question is too big or too small for Chimera to handle.
